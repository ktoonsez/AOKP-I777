Instructions for changes:

1.  Always make changes in stock aokp that you want to add.
2.  Make sure it compiles
	a.  If it does run cp_from_aokp.sh to make it backup to our github version
	b.  run git add .
	c.  run git commit -m "NAME OF CHANGE"
	d.  run git push origin
3.  If it does NOT compile and you can not fix the issue and need to start over
	a.  just copy the files back from the github dir back over top of stock AOKP


Instructions for bringing in CM stuff:
1.  run cp_from_cm_to_aokp.sh (this just copies the CM kernel to the AOKP kernel dir right now)
